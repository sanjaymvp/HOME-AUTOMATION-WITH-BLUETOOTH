TASK DESCRIPTION:

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Bluetooth-controlled LED lighting system using an Arduino UNO, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, a 1-channel relay module, and a 12V LED strip. The system enables wireless control of the LED strip through an Android smartphone by sending commands over Bluetooth. When a user sends specific commands via a mobile app (like "1" or "0"), the Arduino interprets the input and activates or deactivates the relay, which in turn controls the power supplied to the LED strip. This setup demonstrates basic principles of embedded system interfacing, wireless communication, and actuator control using microcontrollers. It is ideal for smart home lighting automation and DIY electronics learning.
